          <h3>BUdget</h3>
          <p> This was a project created as an entry the 2024 Boston Hacks for the challenges Reimagine Reality and 
            the Campus Solution Challenge. It can be agreed upon that budgeting is one of the 
            biggest struggles in college. This website helps relieve some of the stress by creating
            a budget personalized to the user based on their expenses and allowing them organize their finances. There are Tips for 
            Terriers, as well as links to the dining plans and a nutritional calculator created in order to help users find out 
            their other expenses and add them to their budget. The goal of this website was to make budgeting more friendly to the average 
            student without the hassle of overcomplicating things. The website implements AI to give students an optimized way 
            of handling their finances by using how much they want to save in a certain amount of time to figure out how much 
            they should be saving by the end of each month. This website was created mainly using javascript but also some css 
            and html for a few of the many different pages. 

            The project can be seen in action <a target="_blank" href="https://devpost.com/software/budget-rw6tg9" >here.</a></p>

          <h3>The Online Closet</h3>
          <p>An application that allows users to store clothing or other inventory items into one place. 
            The application allows the user to sort their items into categories and edit/delete items after adding them. 
            It can also be altered to send alerts when the quantity/stock of an item is too low.  This application integrated 
            User Authentication, User Registration, and Item Editing/Deleting into the application. It was programmed using 
            Python with Django and HTML</p>
