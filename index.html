	  <h1>About Me</h1>
	  <p>Hi, my name is Ishveen Kaur and I’m from Kansas City. I am currently a Computer Science student at Boston University in my sophomore year. 
		  On campus I am the public relations chair for the Italian Learning Club, a member of Women in Computer Science, and a facilitator for Girls Who Code. 
		  Outside of school, I like watching shows and movies, crocheting, and exploring different places. 
		  Some of my current goals are to gain some professional experience to find out what I would like to do in the future. 
		  If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out. 
		  You can connect with me on Linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/ishveen-kaur5 or  email me at ishveenk05@gmail.com.
